# keras-voxresnet
A keras re-implementation of VoxResNet (Hao Chen et.al) for volumetric image classification.

keras-voxresnet enables __volumetric image classification__ with keras and tensorflow/theano.

Note that the original VoxResNet architecture was designed for volumetric image segmentation which is not yet implemented here.

The implementation is built upon the keras implementation of resnet  [keras-resnet](https://github.com/raghakot/keras-resnet).
